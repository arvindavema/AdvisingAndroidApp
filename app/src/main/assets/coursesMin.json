During the course we will workwith UMD s MITH (Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities), in order to create a digital humanities platform (a web page) in which we will showcase the work you will produce throughout the course. The main characteristicof the digital humanities is to employ technological tools to present humanities subjects under new light.

However, the phenomenon of the Renaissance coincided with an age of global exploration, commerce, trade, and colonialism, allof which expanded the ideas of the Renaissance to every corner of Europe, the Mediterranean, the New World, and beyond. During the course we will workwith UMD s MITH (Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities), in order to create a digital humanities platform (a web page) in which we will showcase the work you will produce throughout the course. The main characteristicof the digital humanities is to employ technological tools to present humanities subjects under new light. In this case, the work will take the form of 3-D architectural models, use of GIS tools, image editing, or other digital-technological tools in order to produce a public pedagogical resource on the subject of the Global Renaissance.",

The field of science communication ventures that the answer is not simply a matter of improving capacity (e.g., because people lack scientific information, scientists lack communication skills, or both). Rather, it calls for sustained collaboration and empathy between laypersons and experts.  In this hands-on, experiential course, we use a model of cultural competency to put forth solutions to bridge the expert-lay divide. We investigate typical venues in which science is communicated (museums, YouTube videos, federal agency websites, and much much more) and study best practices for communication. Then we explore emerging venues that support sustained contact between so-called \"lay citizens\" and scientific or technical experts (dance/improv techniques, ethnographic methods and citizen science). Students learn to use cross-cultural perspectives as a basis to pilot and test ways of strengthening relationships and improving communication.",

As the population increases and the number of large urban areas keeps growing (both in U.S. and internationally), managing water in urban areas is becoming more challenging. Water must be supplied for domestic, commercial, and industrial use, as well as irrigation and maintaining and enhancing local environments (e.g., urban streams). In addition, stormwater must be managed to prevent flooding and environmental damage, and used water, which contains organic matter, nutrients, and other constituents that can be extracted and reused, must be collected and managed. In this course we take a systems approach to urban water hydrology, engineering, planning and management.

Will the U.S. and China be able to forge a closer partnership that will enable them to cooperate in dealing with some of the vexing challenges facing the international community?  Or are they more likely to drift toward a more adversarial relationship, as China's growing power--and the US reaction--generate a vicious cycle of mutual mistrust?

Most people in all societies learn and use their native language or languages with apparent ease - but don't be fooled: languages are highly complex, and speaking and understanding language requires some amazing feats of mental acrobatics. Thus there are many opportunities for difficulties with language, which is the focus of our field. Understanding difficulties with speech, language, and hearing require first understanding how processing works when language is successful - the psychological (behavioral) and neurobiological (brain) factors that enable people to learn and use language despite its intricacies, the structure and properties of language itself, and how knowledge of language is acquired, represented, and processed in the mind and brain.",

So we'll be talking this semester about the marginalized, the downtrodden, the rank and file, the rabble - all the people who never make it onto monuments or money. The point of this is to allow us all to recognize the fundamental fact that fighting a Revolution is a collective act that requires a genuine mass movement. Declaring independence on a piece of parchment on a summer's day in Philadelphia in 1776 doesn't mean anything unless tens of thousands of people are willing to support that cause and fight to make it a reality. To revolt, then, is not an individual act - it's for crowds, for mobs, and for whole communities to do together. Declaring independence is a fundamentally cooperative act.",

We will listen to live and studio performances by Paul Robeson, Mahalia Jackson, Billie Holiday, Abbey Lincoln and Max Roach, Nina Simone, Fela Kuti, Marvin Gaye, Aretha Franklin, Bob Marley, Michael Jackson, Public Enemy, NWA, Lil' Kim, Lauryn Hill, Beyonce, Kendrick Lamar, Frank Ocean, and others. Among the questions we will ponder are the following: What does protest sound like? Does all protest happen on picket lines and must all protest music entail overt political statements set to melody? At various historical junctures, how have black people mobilized music (and art more broadly) to shape and impact their political conditions? What can music accomplish that artforms like literature and visual art cannot? How have various social justice and liberation movements--including Abolitionism, the Civil Rights Movement, the Black Power Movement, the Movement for Black Lives, and beyond--deployed music?

These topics blend multiple academic disciplines into an analytical, systems, and abstract analysis approach to problem solving. Students will develop an understanding of organizations, how groups make decisions, and how one can influence those decisions. This is driven by the development of two parallel analysis techniques: quantitative and qualitative. The quantitative analysis techniques include such areas as systems design, data analysis, and process modeling. These are paired with qualitative techniques, including organizational analysis, decision modeling, and stakeholder analysis. This course is self-contained in that the topics covered are assessed within the course, but it is paired with and designed to be taken prior to Transform Maryland: Theories into Practice (HNUH219P), wherein students undertake a real-world consulting engagement for their client--the University of Maryland--to improve its business processes.",

We will interrogate concepts such as peace, conflict, and violence, the different forms that these phenomena can take, and how we can measure their occurrence. We will discuss theoretical explanations for why individuals and groups have disputes and why these actors choose to use violence (or not) in these disputes and examine these arguments in specific cases.

In 2020, a pandemic has given this question a new urgency. Nothing about the old way of doing things seems inevitable anymore; everything seems up for debate. Should we get rid of lecture halls? What about dorms? The SATs? Tuition? This seminar invites students to deliberate about the current policies and politics of public higher education in the United States. We will study how ancient ideas about merit, democracy, and equity (or lack thereof) have shaped decisions about what higher education should offer and to whom. We will look to alternative traditions of learning with roots in indigenous worldviews, abolitionist organizing, and feminist collaboration, and study how these traditions have challenged and complemented public higher education. As we explore theories and practices of the past and present, students will learn to articulate and advocate for their own priorities as 21st-century citizens of UMD.",

While many societal challenges are seriously impacting local, regional and global communities, an increasing availability of information has contributed to what many call a \"Post-Truth Era,\" where emotions and personal beliefs override scientifically valid evidence and explanations. We will consider the institutional use of post-truth a form of information weaponization. This course asks how information weaponization impacts the evaluation of valid lines of evidence and explanations. How do we evaluate and what is needed to improve individuals' evaluations of claims in the post-truth era? Combatting mythological and unproductive thinking in the face of current change requires increased digital literacy. We will learn enhanced reasoning, evaluation skills, and critical thinking.",

Race, class, gender, sexual preference, and other markers have strong influences on where we spend our time, what we eat, and how we work and relax. Suburbs, cities, wilds, and farms are not just physical places, they exhibit histories of social inclusion and exclusion. For example, the money and free time of affluent Americans serves as a portal to leisure spaces that would be inaccessible to working-class Americans who lack the ability to take time off, drive or fly long distances, and pay for it all. We'll profile identity ecology through the poetry of African American urban naturalists, essays of wilderness-loving men like Edward Abbey, the comedy of white environmental outrage, and the racialized class tensions in resorts like Aspen, CO.

No level of lead exposure is safe: even at extremely low levels, lead can cause a brain injury that affects a child cognitively, behaviorally and physically.

Conditional probabilities, the Bayes formula, and properties of jointly distributed random variables are covered. Limit theorems, which investigate the behavior of a sum of a large number of random variables, are discussed. The main concepts random processes are then introduced. The latter part of the course concerns the basic problems of mathematical statistics, in particular, point and interval estimation and hypothesis testing.",

Specific topics include the key concept of backpropagation and its importance to reduce the computational cost of the training of the neural nets, a discussion of some of the various coding tools available and how they use parallelization, and a presentation and study of convolutional neural networks. Additional topics may include autoencoders, variational autoencoders, convolutional neural networks, recurrent and recursive neural networks, generative adversarial networks, and attention-based models.

Additionally, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that by 2020, Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs) will account for 80 percent of the global burden of disease, causing seven out of every 10 deaths in developing countries. To avert this situation, an integrated approach that involves all stakeholders - producers, processors, distributors, consumers, policy makers and research institutions - must be developed. A number of initiatives have already been implemented to examine how agriculture could be leveraged to become a more powerful tool to tackle the persistent problems of food insecurity, malnutrition, and poor health. This course will seek to build on the momentum created by these and similar conversations and initiatives to prepare students and participants to develop global solutions fit for local contexts that bridge the gap between agricultural development and its largely unfulfilled health and nutritional benefits.

Issues will include the nature of sportsmanship, what types of violence in sports are acceptable, drug use in sports, what it means to be a fan (for example, asking why loyalty to your team is valuable) and how our view of sports interacts with our view of nations.

We may also introduce some alternative, or non-classical logics. Although the subject of symbolic logic was developed by mathematicians and philosophers for their own special purposes (which we will discuss), logical concepts and techniques have found applications in a variety of disciplines, including computer science, economics, law, linguistics, and psychology. We may also consider some of these applications.",

The objective of this course is to provide graduate students with knowledge of pathogenesis and transmission of globally evolving pathogens. Registered students for this course are expected to know fundamentals of infectious diseases. References from the peer reviewed journals will be provided to facilitate understanding of the selected topics. Opening of this course is necessary to help graduate students to stay up-to-date with currently emerging pathogens and their evolution with changes in environment. This course is complementary to other existing microbiology courses (i.e., Viral Pathogenesis) on campus. Lectures focus on an in-depth analysis of a variety of topics in current infectious diseases. The course highlights recently published literatures to evaluate evolving trends in infectious diseases. The covered topics include subjects related with various pathogens and their adaptation strategy to enhance pathogenicity and transmissibility. The lectures will also cover the control and prevention measures of these pathogens.",
