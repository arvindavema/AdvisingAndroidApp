    <string name="undergrad_overview">At the Department of Computer Science, undergraduates are a priority. Here, you will meet 3,400 (and counting) of the nation\'s top computer science majors. This diverse group of students has interests ranging from systems to programming languages, from algorithms to design and from VR to Robotics. While you are an undergraduate here, you will study fundamentals in computing including programming languages and theory, which will help you later in a variety of courses we offer at the 400-level. After taking classes, perhaps doing research, participating in our honors program, or studying abroad, and completing internships, our students go on to some of the best graduate programs in the world or join start-ups, small and large tech companies, consulting firms, or government organizations.</string>
